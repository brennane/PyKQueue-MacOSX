Python Extension Module for Kernel Queues

This is PyKQueue-MacOSX.  
It works with Twisted's kqreactor on Mac OS X, as of Twisted 8.2.0.

It is based on PyKQueue 1.4, found here:
http://ox.eicat.ca/~dgilbert/files/PyKQueue.html

Which is in turn based on PyKQueue 1.1 through 1.3, found here:
http://people.freebsd.org/~dwhite/PyKQueue/

I've added a setup.py and patches for OS X found here:
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/perezvon/20070219/1171890423

That patch appears to be based on this one:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.kqreactor.html

There's a PyKQueue 2.0 in the Twisted repository, which is an
API-incompatible update to this code.  It aims to work on Mac OS X and
FreeBSD, but is incompatible with the released version of Twisted as
of 8.2.0.  It can be found here:

After a brief email dicussion with dwhite@freebsd.org, I took possession
of this.  I don't have the ambition he states below, but I needed to add
several different event types.  While adding the ones I required, I added
others from the file.

This is an early version of a Python module to handle kernel queues (kqueues) 
as implemented by Johnathan Lemon (jlemon@freebsd.org).  Information on the 
kqueue system and patches are at http://www.flugsvamp.com/~jlemon/fbsd/kq.txt.

This version of PyKQueue, 1.2, supports the new kevent(2) API in FreeBSD 
4.1-RELEASE and 5-CURRENT (osreldate 50011).  

Sam Rushing and I are working on a totally revamped version of this module
that pushes all the code into C instead of the split system used here.  
The new module should be many times more efficient than this one. Stay tuned
for details.

Enjoy.
